**Traffic-Optimization-at-Intersection**


Managing urban traffic, especially at busy intersections, is a major headache for modern cities. The old-school traffic lights with their fixed timings just can't keep up with the changing traffic volumes and conditions, leading to long waits, congestion, and more pollution. It's clear that we need smarter solutions to keep our city traffic flowing smoothly.

That's where intelligent traffic signal control systems come in. By harnessing machine learning and real-time data, these systems can adjust traffic signals based on what's actually happening on the roads. This means smoother traffic flow, shorter wait times, and a more responsive approach to emergencies. Imagine a system that detects heavy traffic or an approaching ambulance and adjusts the signals accordingly – that's the future of urban traffic management.

Our project focuses on creating just such a system, using the YOLOv8 model for precise vehicle detection. We'll compare existing algorithms, build a model that prioritizes congested lanes and emergency vehicles, and test it in a real-world intersection scenario. The aim is to improve traffic flow and ensure emergency vehicles can get through quickly, making our city streets more efficient and safer for everyone.

The proposed vehicle detection and traffic signal control system integrates advanced machine learning and adaptive scheduling to optimize traffic management. Leveraging a custom-trained YOLOv8 model, the system accurately detects and classifies vehicles, including emergency vehicles like police cars and ambulances, in real-time from traffic camera feeds. Integrated with Ultralytic’s default tracker, the YOLO model maintains vehicle positions and counts. This real-time data is fed into a priority-based scheduling algorithm, which dynamically adjusts green light durations. The algorithm prioritizes lanes with emergency vehicles and allocates green time based on the vehicle count in each lane. By combining accurate vehicle detection with adaptive signal adjustments, the system enhances traffic flow efficiency and ensures rapid passage for emergency vehicles.
